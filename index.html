        Description
        <hr style="width: 155px">
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large terrestrial bird with an eagle-like head and body on crane-like legs. 
        It stands about 1.3 m tall. It has a length of between 112 and 150 cm and a wingspan of between 191 and 215 cm. 
        The weight ranges from 3.74 to 4.27 kg , with a mean of 4.05 kg. The tarsus averages 31 cm and the tail is 57–85 cm: both factor 
        into making it both taller and longer than any other species of raptor. The neck is not especially long, and can only be lowered 
        down to the intertarsal joint, so birds must stoop to reach down to the ground. During flight, two elongated central feathers of 
        the tail extend beyond the feet, and the neck stretches out like a stork. The plumage of the crown, upperparts, and lesser and 
        median wing coverts is blue-grey, and the underparts and underwing coverts are lighter grey to grey-white. The crest is made up 
        of long black feathers arising from the nape. The scapulars, primary and secondary flight feathers, rump and thighs are black, 
        while the uppertail coverts are white, though barred with black in some individuals. The tail is wedge-shaped with white tipping, 
        marbled grey and black colouring at the base, and two broad black bands, one at the base and the other at the end.
        <br><br>
        Sexes resemble one another, although the male tends to have longer tail feathers, more head plumes, a shorter head and more blue-grey 
        plumage. Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow cere. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, 
        the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short—around 20% of the length of those of an eagle of the same size—and stout, 
        so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet. The rear toe is small and the three forward facing toes are connected at 
        the base by a small web. Immature birds have yellow rather than orange bare skin on their faces, more brownish plumage, shorter tail 
        feathers and greyish rather than brown irises.
        <br><br>
        Adults are normally silent but can utter a deep guttural croaking noise in nuptial displays or at nests. Secretarybirds make this sound 
        when greeting their mates or in a threat display or fight against other birds, sometimes throwing their head backwards at the same time. 
        When alarmed, the secretarybird may emit a high-pitched croak. Mated pairs at the nest make soft clucking or whistling calls. Chicks make 
        a sharp sound heard as "chee-uk-chee-uk-chee-uk" for their first 30 days.

      <h2>Behaviour</h2>
      <hr style="width: 138px">
      <p>
        Secretarybirds are not generally gregarious aside from pairs and their offspring. They usually roost in trees of the genus Acacia or 
        Balanites, or even introduced pine trees in South Africa. They set off 1–2 hours after dawn, generally after spending some time preening. 
        Mated pairs roost together but may forage separately, though often remaining in sight of one another. They pace around at a speed of 
        2.5–3 km/h, taking 120 steps per minute on average. After spending much of the day on the ground, secretarybirds return at dusk, moving 
        downwind before flying in upwind. Birds encountered singly are often unattached males, their territories generally in less suitable areas. 
        Conversely, larger groups of up to 50 individuals may be present at an area with a localised resource such as a waterhole in a dry area or 
        an irruption of rodents or locusts fleeing a fire.
        <br><br>
        Secretarybirds soar with their primary feathers splayed to manage turbulence. Their wings can flap, though in a slow laborious manner 
        and requiring uplift to be sustained; otherwise they may become exhausted. In the heat of the day, they use thermals to rise up to 3,800m 
        above the ground.
        <br><br>
        The lifespan is thought to be 10 to 15 years in the wild, with the oldest confirmed by banding to be 5 years from a nestling banded on 23 July 2011 
        in Bloemfontein and recovered 440 km away in Mpumalanga on 7 June 2016, and up to 19 years in captivity. Secretarybirds, like all birds, have 
        haematozoan blood parasites that include Leucocytozoon beaurepairei Dias 1954 recorded from Mozambique. Wild birds from Tanzania have been 
        found to have Hepatozoon ellisgreineri, a genus that is unique among avian haematozoa in maturing within granulocytes, mainly heterophils. 
        Ectoparasites include the lice Neocolpocephalum cucullare and Falcolipeurus secretarius.

      <!--Food & Feeding-->
      <h2>Food & Feeding</h2>
      <hr style="width: 226px">
      <p>
        Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird is largely terrestrial, hunting its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as loose 
        familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides. Prey may consist of insects such as locusts and beetles, mammals ranging 
        in size from mice to hares and mongoose, crabs, lizards, snakes, tortoises, small birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in 
        grass or bush fires. Larger herbivores are not generally hunted, although there are some reports of secretarybirds killing young gazelles and 
        cheetah cubs. The importance of snakes in the diet has been exaggerated in the past, although they can be locally important and venomous 
        species such as adders and cobras are regularly among the types of snake preyed upon. Secretarybirds do not eat carrion.

        The birds often flush prey from tall grass by stomping on the surrounding vegetation. Their crest feathers may raise during a hunt, which 
        may serve to help scare the target and provide shade for the face. A bird will chase after prey with the wings spread and kill by striking 
        with swift blows of the feet. Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick them directly. There are some reports 
        that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been 
        verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they 
        will hold down a food item with their feet while tearing it apart with their bill.

        Food that cannot be digested is regurgitated as pellets 40–45 mm in diameter and 30–100 mm in length. These are dropped on the ground usually 
        near the roost or nest trees. The secretarybird has a relatively short digestive tract in comparison to large African birds with more mixed diets, 
        such as the kori bustard. The foregut is specialised for the consumption of large amounts of meat and there is little need for the mechanical 
        breakdown of food. The crop is dilated and the gizzard is nonmuscular, as in other carnivorous birds. The large intestine has a pair of vestigial 
        ceca as there is no requirement for the fermentative digestion of plant material.

        Secretarybirds specialise in stomping their prey until it is killed or immobilised. This method of hunting is commonly applied to lizards or 
        snakes. An adult male trained to strike at a rubber snake on a force plate was found to hit with a force equal to five times its own body 
        weight, with a contact period of only 10–15 milliseconds. This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual 
        targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, 
        frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought 
        to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping and striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running 
        efficiency. Ecophysiologist Steve Portugal and colleagues have hypothesised that the extinct Phorusrhacidae (terror birds) may have employed a 
        similar hunting technique to secretarybirds because they are anatomically similar, although they are not closely related.

        Secretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, except in the case of tawny eagles, which will steal their kills. Eagles mainly steal larger 
        prey and will attack secretarybirds both singly or in pairs. Secretarybird pairs are sometimes successful in driving the eagles away and may 
        even knock them down and pin them to the ground.

      <!--Cultural Significance-->
      <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
      <hr style="width: 299px">
      <p>
        The secretarybird is depicted on an ivory knife handle recovered from Abu Zaidan in Upper Egypt, dating to the Naqada III culture (c. 3,200 BC). 
        This and other knife handles indicate the secretarybird most likely occurred historically further north along the Nile

        The secretarybird has traditionally been admired in Africa for its striking appearance and ability to deal with pests and snakes. As such it has 
        often not been disturbed, although this is changing as traditional observances have declined. It is a prominent feature on the coat of arms of 
        South Africa, which was adopted in 2000. With its wings outstretched, it represents growth, and its penchant for killing snakes is symbolic as 
        the protector of the South African state against enemies. It is on the emblem of Sudan, adopted in 1969. It is featured on the Sudanese presidential 
        flag and presidential seal. The secretarybird has been a common motif for African countries on postage stamps: over a hundred stamps from 37 issuers 
        are known, including some from stamp-issuing entities such as Ajman, Manama, and the Maldives, regions where the bird does not exist, as well 
        as the United Nations.

        The Maasai people call it ol-enbai nabo, or "one arrow", referring to its crest feathers. They have used parts of the bird in traditional medicine: 
        its feathers could be burnt and the resulting smoke inhaled to treat epilepsy, its egg could be consumed with tea twice daily to treat headaches, 
        and its fat could be boiled and drunk for child growth or livestock health. The Xhosa people call the bird inxhanxhosi and attribute great intelligence 
        to it in folklore. The Zulus call it intungunono.

        The German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach proposed in 2008 that the secretarybird was recorded in the 13th-century work De arte venandi cum avibus by Holy 
        Roman Emperor Frederick II. Described as bistarda deserti, it was mistaken for a bustard. Frederick most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources 
        in Egypt. The 16th-century French priest and traveller André Thevet also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by 
        Kinzelbach to this species.

        In the Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks, one of the residents of Naboombu, the assistant to King Leonidas, is a secretarybird. Both the secretarybird 
        and the king are voiced by Lennie Weinrib.
